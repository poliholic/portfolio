## Ryan's ReadMe

Random thoughts in no particular order...

FAIL = I'm useless trying to build anything from scratch. "How would you ______?" No.
WIN = I can figure things out. I can tell what I'm looking at. "What is _____ doing? Yes.
Win = I can Google through the earth's crust to China. I can find anything.

THUS. This code is all torn out of other places on the Interwebs. Then heavily manipulated.

RE: Design
    + I have a fetish for design, and spend way too much time belaboring how it looks.
    + I also suck at / steal / manipulate other designs.
    + I literally look up "_____ trends for 2017" to get design ideas.
    + General preference is for big, landscape images and minimal text.
    + I prefer burrowing content...give a little, then more, then more.

Bootstrap and Font Awesome are my new best friends.


Starter code stolen from ---
Sliding side nav stolen from ---
THIS SITE'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT is the dynamic title/favicon.
    + It was the first JS code to go in.
    + Stole the idea from Act Normal
    + Could find pieces of code, but not the whole thing. Actually built that one!


## WTF?!?
  Things I can't understand, couldn't understand but figured out, or are buggy:
  + a[href*=#]:not([href=#] -- For page scrolling...grabs all #tags except #   , ie not the top of page.
  + Need loop through portfolio imgs to do individually. Need more pics for that first. This is a test
  + Gotta fix the animation on the down arrow.
  + Will add new pages for different portfolio items? Or transforming windows?
